        <h2>Inspection</h2>
        <p>
          Inspection can be divided into four parts: rotors, housings,
          side irons (or side housings) and eccentric shaft. Before inspection,
          you’ll need to unbolt and remove the front and rear stationary gears.
        </p>

          <h3>Rotors:</h3>
        <p>
          Each rotor consists of the following:
        </p>

          <ul>
            <li>3 apex seals and 6 apex seal springs</li>
            <li>6 side seals and side seal springs</li>
            <li>4 circular oil seals with springs and o-rings</li>
            <li>2 circular compression cut-off seals with springs</li>
            <li>1 rotor bearing</li>
            <li>6 corner seals, with plugs and springs</li>
          </ul>

        <p>
          As a note, you’ll want to store everything you remove in such a way
          that you can identify it’s exact position on it’s rotor while on
          the bench. Start by removing the apex, corner and side seals and
          their respective springs. Then carefully remove the circular oil
          and compression seals with a pair of small flat-bladed screwdrivers.
           Again, you’ll need to know which rotor/side/face these parts came
           from when measuring. Additionally, label each rotor (front/rear)
            because they may be balanced differently. Finally remove the rotor
             bearings with a shop press.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clean the rotors and seals before measurement. If you don’t have a
          parts washer (links to parts washers on the <a href="links.html">Links</a> page), you can
          remove the carbon and grease with a combination of parts solvent,
          brake parts cleaner, picks and screwdrivers. Be careful not to
          damage the rotor while cleaning. You’ll want to clean the grooves
          for all of the seals and gently clean the rotor faces and sides.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are four rotor areas to inspect to ensure the rotor is ready
          for additional service. If the rotor fails any of these inspections,
          replace the rotor. First, use a micrometer to measure the clearance
          between the rotor and side housing. This is done by measuring the
          width of the rotor housing, and subtracting the width of the rotor
          (as measured from the inside with the micrometer against the rotor round).
          The difference between side housing width and rotor width must be
          between .0020”-.0074”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then measure the protrusion of the rotor round by placing a machinist’s
          straight-edge on the side of the rotor in alignment with one of the
          three rotor apexes. Use a feeler gauge to measure the gap between the
          rotor face and the straight-edge. This should be between .0048”-.007”.
          Do this for each of the three apexes, on each of the four rotor faces.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, measure the width of the corner seal grooves using an inside
          micrometer. If the width is >= .43488”, replace the rotor. If the
          width is between .43381”-.43488” use a .03mm oversized corner seal.
           Otherwise the corner seal groove is ok and the rotor is ok. Repeat
            this for all 12 corner seal grooves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, measure the apex seal side groove width by using a feeler
          gauge to measure the gap between the side of a clean apex seal and
          the rotor. If the clearance exceeds .0017”-.0039” replace the apex
          seal.  If clearance exceeds those specifications with a new apex seal,
           replace the rotor. You can also inspect oil seals, side seals and
           apex seals for reuse, but I would generally recommend replacing these
            (and their springs) while you’ve got the engine apart.

          <h3>Rotor Housings:</h3>
          <p>
            Rotor housings receive a visual inspection to check for scoring,
            flaking or discoloration (above top). If any of these are observed,
            it’s recommended to replace the housing. Use a micrometer to measure
            the difference in width of the housings in four places (above bottom).
             If the difference between A and any other locations is > .0024”,
             replace the housing.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Side Housings:</h3>
          <p>
            Side housings should be measured for flatness in several areas using
            a machinist’s straight-edge. If any measurement is out of specification,
             the corresponding housing should be replaced. Some rebuilders have
              been successful with having these machined, but removing more than
               .0025” will require the housing to be re-nitrided. First, measure
                each of the four side housing faces for > .0016” of distortion
                along the four planes demonstrated. Then use a dial gauge to
                check the following areas for wear.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Vertical Wear: >.0039"</li>
            <li>Convex Oval Oil Seal Paths (A > .0004", B > .0039")</li>
            <li>Oil Seal Stepped Path Wear > .0008"</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

        <h3>Eccentric Shaft</h3>
        <p>
          The eccentric shaft should be placed on v blocks and main journal
          runout should be measured with a dial indicator. If runout exceeds
          .0024” replace the eccentric shaft. Additionally, inspect the
          eccentric shaft oil shaft for clogging and clean with compressed air
           if necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before reassembly, you’ll want to press new bearings into the front
          and rear stationary gears, and rotors. There are links to service tools
          for pressing these bearings in/out of rotors and gears on our links
          page. You will also want to replace the front and rear oil seals after
          replacing the bearings, and ensuring proper eccentric shaft oil clearance.
        </p>
        <p>
          To measure eccentric shaft oil clerance, you’ll need to measure the
           difference in eccentric shaft journal outside diameter and bearing
           inside diameter to calculate bearing oil clearance. If the clearance
           is > .0039”, replace the rotor bearing. If the clearance is too great,
            even with larger bearings, replace the eccentric shaft. Perform the
            same procedure with main bearings, replacing if clearance is > .0039”
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, replace the pilot bearing in the rear of the eccentric shaft.
           You can return your pilot bearing to service with new lubrication if
            the needle rollers spin freely and smoothly, but it’s best if this
             is simply replaced while it’s convenient.
