        <h2>Assembly</h2>

        <h3>Rotor Assembly</h3>
        <p>
          Assembly begins with the rotors. First, measure side seal clearances.
           This is done by placing a .0059” feeler gauge in the tapered edge of
            the side seal groove, along with the side seal. Then, with new corner
             seals in place, measure the gap between the corner seal and side
              seal. Technically this is to be the sum total of gap measured at
               each end, but you can slide the seal all the way to one side and
               measure from the other as well. Maximum side seal clearance should
                be .016”, but it’s recommended to keep clearances between .002”-.0059”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most vendors sell cut-to-length side seals, so you’ll need to grind
          your seals down with sandpaper and finish the ends with a whetstone.
          Its important that you keep the angle of the end of the side parallel
          with the corner seals to ensure a proper seal as the engine warms up.
           Here are several links to videos that explain this process in greater
           detail. Once a side seal is fitted to a pair of corner seals, be sure
            that they are installed in the same places as rotor side lengths are
             not perfectly equal.
        </p>

            Another video explaining side seal cutting</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Once side seals are fitted, remove them from the rotors. Insert new
           o-rings to the 4 inner and 4 outer oil control rings with a thick
           coat of petroleum jelly. For each rotor side, lay the rotor on a flat
           working surface. Using the table below, identify the correct oil ring
            spring for the rotor face you are working on. Place the rounded end
             of the spring face down and rotate until it catches in the appropriate
              rotation lock  depression. This will help keep the oil control
               ring from rotating during operation. Then use the old oil control
                rings and a board to carefully press the new oil control ring
                into the appropriate groove on the rotor face. Once the oil control
                 rings are installed, place the cut-off seal spring (pink side up)
                  in the cut-off seal groove. Then place the cut-off seal in it’s
                  groove, with the two ends meeting flush at the lock pin. Cover
                   the cut-off seal with a coat of petroleum jelly.

        <p>
          Once the rings are assembled, for all four rotor faces, we can install
          the corner seals and side seals that were fitted earlier. Be sure the
          side seal spring ends are facing upwards, and the corner seal grooves
          are facing upwards towards the apex seal grooves. Also make sure that
          corner seals are installed with the large diameter end of the corner
          seal plugs are facing towards the rotor, otherwise they’ll come loose
          from the corner seals and interfere with the side housings. Finally,
          be sure to include a generous layer of petroleum jelly under all of
          these seals. The jelly acts as a combustible adhesive that helps keep
           the side and corner seals in the rotor assembly when placed back in
           the engine. Once those are in place, you can install the apex seals
           and apex seal springs. I would recommend using a rubber band to
           retain the apex seal springs while they’re waiting for installation.
            This will allow you to install the rotors without trying to install
             the apex seal springs afterwards. Include a generous coat of
             petroleum jelly on the exterior of all seal surfaces, and coat
             the inside diameter of the rotor bearing with assembly lubricant.
             The rotor assembly is complete and ready for installation.

          <h3>Rotor Housing Preparation</h3>
          <p>
            Before assembling the engine, water jacket and engine seals must be
             installed in the rotor housings. This is different from previous
             rotary engines, where they were installed in the side housings.
              Before installation, be sure the rotor housings are clean and free
              of debris which may impair installation or damage the engine during
              operation. Lay each rotor housing face flat on a clean work surface.
               Lay a bead of petroleum jelly into the grooves for the inner and
               outer rotor housing o-rings. Again this will keep these components
               in place during assembly. Then install the rotor housing o-rings
                into their corresponding grooves. The white paint on the outer
                o-ring must not be showing, and the inner seal joint should be
                between the 10 o’clock and 12 o’clock positions (pictured). As
                a side note, some rebuilders will use hylomar instead of
                petroleum jelly for the rotor housing o-rings. I haven’t tried
                this, but can confirm that petroleum jelly is capable of working
                 without issue. Install the dowel o-rings on the top portion of
                 the rotor housing and seal with hylomar. Finally, coat the inside
                  of the rotor housing with a thin coat of petroleum jelly or
                  assembly lubricant.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h3>Engine Assembly</h3>
          <p>
            At last, the engine components are ready for assembly. Start by
            bolting the front stationary gear to the front side housing and the
             rear stationary gear to the rear side housing, and lubricating the
              gears and bearings of both. Then mount the front housing to the engine
              stand. Then slide lubricated dowels into the appropriate bore on
              the front housing. Place a bead of silicone sealant on the areas of
               the rotor housing indicated (see picture) and slide the rotor
               housing over the dowels and onto the front housing. At this point,
                the silicone sealant will start to dry and assembly needs to be
                completed before that drying occurs. Place a coat of assembly
                lubricant on the face of the front housing. Place the front rotor
                 inside the front rotor housing (gear side facing down). Be sure
                  that all seals in both the housings and the rotors are in place
                   as they are installed. Then slide the eccentric shaft into the
                   front rotor and front main bearing, and rotate slightly to
                   remove any tension.
          </p>

      <div id="para3">
        <p>
          Before installing the intermediate housing, apply a coat of assembly
          lubricant on the rearward face of the front rotor, and a bead of
          silicone sealant to the same areas as the other side of the rotor
          housing. Then lift the eccentric shaft a few inches vertically and
           angle the inner bore of the intermediate housing over the rear rotor
            journal of the eccentric shaft. Align the intermediate housing with
             the dowel pins and lay flat against the front rotor housing.
             Installation of the rear rotor and rotor housing is the same as
              the front, with the exception of placing the rear rotor over
              the eccentric shaft during installation. Then install the rear
              side housing. Lubricate the tension bolts and install washers on
               all except the bottom bolt on the exhaust side of the engine.
                The three indented bolts are to be installed as shown. Torque
                to 23-29 ft-lb in two three passes in the sequence shown. It’s
                 also recommended to rotate the engine using the flywheel nut
                 to keep any parts from binding.
        </p>

          Great, now the short block is assembled. Before putting everything
           back together, we must check eccentric shaft end play. Using the
           locking tool, install the flywheel and torque to 289-361 ft-lbs.
           Then rotate the engine so that the front is facing upwards and
            install the following in this order.

        <p>
          Apply engine oil to the pulley boss lockbolt and torque to 222-250
          ft-lb. Then use a dial indicator to measure eccentric shaft end play.
           If it exceeds .0016”-.0035” replace the spacer with a thinner
           version. If less than .0016” use a thicker spacer. Spacer types are
           detailed in the table below. If this is within specifications, remove
           the pulley components and oil pump drive gears and resume assembly.

        Install the oil pump as it was removed, with the chain over the drive
        gear and the sprocket. Torque the oil pump sprocket nut to 23.2-34 ft-lb
         and bend the lock washer up against the side of the nut. Place the oil
          metering pump drive gear on top of the oil pump drive gear. Install
          the front cover, ensuring proper alignment between oil metering pump
           gears. This cover requires a gasket, and bolts should be torqued
            in the order shown to 13.8-18.8 ft-lb. This will require the
            water pump to be installed at the same time, also torqued to
            13.8-18.8 ft-lb.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reinstall the pulley boss. Place the oil control spring and bypass
        valve back into the eccentric shaft as they were removed. Apply
        engine oil to pulley boss lockbolt threads and a layer of silicone
        sealant to the face of the pulley boss lock bolt. Install and tighten
         to 222-250 ft-lb. After this, flip the engine upside down and apply
         a layer of silicone sealant (as pictured) to the oil pan. Place the
          oil pan on the engine and torque bolts to 13.8-18.8 ft-lb. Finally,
          complete reassembly by installing remaining components in the
          reverse order of removal.
