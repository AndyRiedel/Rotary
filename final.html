        <h2>A DIY Resource for Rotary Engine Rebuilding</h2>

        <p>
          Welcome! This is a hub for information and resources related to the
          rebuilding of Mazda's 13b-MSP (Renesis) rotary engine. Here you'll find
          brief overviews of rebuild procedures, links to
          parts suppliers and specialty tools, and links to more in-depth information
          needed to aid in your engine rebuild process. Should you decide a rebuild
          isn't something you'd like to tackle on your own, you'll also find a list
          of rotary engine specialists on the <a href="links.html">Links</a> page.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my experience rebuiling my own S1 RX-8 engine, I found the resources
          I needed scattered throughout various YouTube videos, forum posts,
          workshop manuals and other resources. My aim is to consolidate that information
          for other DIY rebuilders in order to improve the overall health of the RX-8 and
          Mazda rotary community. In the future, I would like to expand the scope
          of this site to include other Mazda rotary engines. Take a look around,
          and if you're interested in contributing to the site click the link above!
